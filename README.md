## Microbial Co-occurrance Network Analysis

This is a tiny data analysis project for demonstrating in M. Sc. Biology module *Network Analysis in Ecology and Beyond* offered by Prof. Dr. Jochen Fründ at University of Hamburg.

The data used here is credited to Deutschmann et al., 2024. Analysis shown in this repo was done by Zhehao Hu and Jan Moritz Fehr.
